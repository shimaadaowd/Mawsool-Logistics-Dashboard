## 🧾 Project Description
This project focuses on **diagnostic data analysis** to uncover operational insights and performance gaps within the logistics workflow.

The analysis emphasizes **key metrics** such as:
- **Staged orders** and their duration buckets (≤2d, 3d, 4–10d, >10d)  
- **Handling time** for each order  
- **Dispatch rate** and **storage utilization**  
- **Non-moving vs total inventory**  

The goal is to provide clear visibility into **what is happening** and **why it’s happening**, supporting more informed business decisions.

## 🧠 Analytical Approach
Throughout the project, I performed:
- **Data Cleaning & Transformation:** Including pivoting, normalization, and type adjustments.  
- **Data Modeling:** Structured fact and dimension tables to ensure relational accuracy.  
- **DAX Measures:** Built custom KPIs and time-based metrics to measure operational performance.  
- **Date Dimension Table:** Created to enable time-series and trend analysis.  
- **Parameterization:** Added a folder path parameter so that anyone can refresh the dataset from a different location without breaking queries.  

This end-to-end process turned raw logistics data into a fully dynamic, diagnostic dashboard.

## 📊 Key Insights
- Identified delays in “staged” orders exceeding 10 days.  
- Measured dispatch performance across warehouse types (ambient vs chiller).  
- Highlighted non-moving inventory percentage to support stock optimization.  
- Evaluated handling time patterns to reveal bottlenecks in operations.

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies
- **Microsoft Excel** – Data cleaning, transformation, and pivot-based modeling.  
- **Power BI** – Dashboard design, DAX measures, and interactive reporting.  
- **DAX & M Query** – Dynamic calculations and parameter handling.

### 🧩 Note
This repository is intended to demonstrate **data analysis, modeling, and DAX skills** —  
not to disclose or represent any internal data from Mawsool or its partners.
